                        <h5>Effective as of January 26, 2024</h5>
                        <p >
                            These terms of service ("Agreement") constitute a contract between you and SkyFleet ELD, a Pennsylvania limited liability corporation, together with its employees, consultants, directors, successors, subsidiaries, affiliates, and assignees ("Company", "we" or "us") and governs the terms under which you may use services offered by us, whether on behalf of yourself or on behalf of a company or other entity for which you are authorized to act.

                        <h4>General.</h4>
                        <p >Entire Agreement.

                        <p >No Waiver. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision and shall not guarantee that Company will repeat any such actions in the future.</p>
                        <p >Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give appropriately valid effect to the intention of this Agreement as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
                        <p >Assignment. This Agreement and any rights granted to you under this Agreement may not be transferred or assigned by you, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise, without our prior written consent, and any such attempted assignment or transfer shall be null and void, except that you may assign this Agreement in its entirety to a purchaser of all or substantially all of your assets or business or in connection with a merger, amalgamation, reorganization, or similar transaction without consent and upon written notice to us.

                        <p >Dispute Resolution. If a dispute arises between you and Company, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns.

                        <p >Arbitration. For any Claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000.00 USD, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost-effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. If a party elects arbitration, that party will initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules:</p>
                        <p >(i) The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or be solely based on written submissions, with the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.</p>
                        <p >(ii) The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.</p>
                        <p >(iii) Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p >Forum for Disputes. Except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described above, you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Company must be resolved by a court located in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>
                        <p >Improperly Filed Litigation. All claims you bring against Company must be resolved in accordance with this Agreement. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Agreement shall be considered improperly filed and a breach of this Agreement. Should you file a claim contrary to this Agreement, Company may recover attorneys' fees and costs from you, provided that we have notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>
